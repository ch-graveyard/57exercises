# Chua Hou's solutions to *Exercises for Programmers* by Brain P. Hogan

## Abandonment note, 22 July 2019

As I progressed up to the 14th problem, I looked through the rest of the
problems and realised they were painfully trivial (that is, not worth the time
and effort to implement).

Hence, as of **22 July 2019**, I am **abandoning this child**. (sniffle sniffle)

Okay bye.

This repository contains my personal work and solutions to the 57 exercises in
the book *Exercises for Programmers* by Brain P. Hogan (ISBN `978-1-68050-122-3`).

## Note on directories

The Makefile assumes that each problem directory has a `build` subdirectory
at the path `[PROBLEM]/build`. If these directories do not exist, simply run
the script `makebuilddirs.sh`.
